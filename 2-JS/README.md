# Havenly JS Quiz

The skeleton for this program was pull from Mozilla's to-do list playground. All of the bugs were introduced later.


## Run locally

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Objectives

There are three bugs present inside of this application and a feature.  The feature is a bonus.  Each of the tasks will be written as Acceptance Criteria.

1. As a user, when I try to add a task, currently I see gobbledygook. I would like to be able to see my to-do title properly in the list.
2. When I add more than one to-do, it repeats previous to-dos along with the new entry.
3. As a user, when I click the checkbox, I expect the task to be greyed out and a line to appear through it when it is done. This is currently not happening.
4. As a user, when I click the delete button, nothing happens.  When I click the delete button I would like the task to go away.
###### Feature (BONUS)
5. As a manager, I would like to only allow users to delete tasks after they have been completed.

### Submission

When you are complete.  Either submit a separate pull request per bug task above. Or submit a single pull request with a commit labelled with the proper bug number and title.
