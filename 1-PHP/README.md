# PHP Data Structure

A large portion of our codebase is in PHP, so it's important to have some familiarity with how PHP functions.  For the most part you won't need to spin up new PHP classes or applications by yourself, but you will have to be able to parse through them and in addition to doing research, solve some minor problems on your own.

## Challenge

There are a set of users who all have information about their birthday and whereabouts in an array.

Your challenge is to finish the methods (`getAllUserNames`, `getBirthday`, `getLocation`, `addUser`, `setLocation` <-- bonus) inside of the `UserInfo.php` file so that they can retrieve that information on demand.

In order to get started
run:

`php run.php`

The goal is to properly output all of the information contained in the arrays back as expected.

## When Complete

When you are done, submit your changes in a PR and copy paste the code output in the description.
