# Algorithm Design

Algorithm design is an important part of software development.  The goal of this activity is to get a sense of how you think through complex sets of problems and come up with a solution. Feel free to google and use help to solve the problem, but document each source in your code.

## Problem

2^15 = 32768 and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26.

What is the sum of the digits of the number 2^20?

### Solution

Feel free to code this in any programming language. Just include runtime instructions for how to execute the solution.  

Also feel free to use sites like http://repl.it to test/run your code.  They can be great problem solving tools.

Also please add comments above each code chunk to explain why you made that specific decision and what it's trying to accomplish.
